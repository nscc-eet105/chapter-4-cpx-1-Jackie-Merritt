# CPX Pixel Functions

### Instructions
This lab is similar to the third part of the CPX Boolean Inputs lab from chapter 3. The difference is that you will use a touch pad to control functions that turn ALL of the pixels on or off (nearly) simultaneously.

### Capacitive Touch Pads
- There are six capacitive touch pads around the edge of the CPX
- They are labeled A1 - A6
- Here is a sample to test pad A1:  
  ![bool4](boolean4.jpg)
- Create a function which turns on all the pixels
  - Use an appropriate loop inside this function
- Create a function which turns off all the pixels
  - Use an appropriate loop inside this function
- Choose a pad. The example uses pad A1
  - If the pad is touched call the function to turn on all the pixels
  - If itâ€™s not being touched then all the pixels should be turned off
- The last part of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9Bid0qoaNCQ) shows an example. The first part of the video
    is the examples from the Boolean Inputs lab.
  
### Turn-ins
- The actual code.py for your project added to this repo
- A video demonstrating the operation (If done remotely)

### Grading
- Proper use of comments  
- Code the pixels_on() function  
- Code the pixels_off() function
- Use of loops
- Code one capacitive button as described  
- A video demonstrating your operation
